          About Me
        </h2>
          <h3><b>Why Web Development?</b></h3>
        <p>
          I have always had a fascination and a natural affinity for technology in general. 
          Growing up, I would tinker a lot with different things on the computer, but never really diving deep until college.
          Some of my favorite memories were the long hours playing around with projects with my classmates as we worked together 
          to come up with solutions for real-world problems. The idea that someone could come up with an idea that helps people do things 
          quicker, easier, and in a completely new (and sometimes revolutionary) way was something I always would get excited about.
          I also love the design aspect of development, and getting to really flex my creative muscles with layouts and styles.
